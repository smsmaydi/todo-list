# To-Do List Application

A simple, responsive To-Do List web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The design is clean and user-friendly, making it easy to manage daily tasks.

## Features

- **Add Task:** Users can add new tasks by typing into the input field and clicking the "Add" button.
- **Delete Task:** Each task has a delete button that allows users to remove the task from the list.
- **Mark as Completed:** Clicking on a task will toggle its status as completed, striking through the text to indicate its completion.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three main files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the web page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the web page and making it responsive.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles task addition, deletion, and completion logic.
